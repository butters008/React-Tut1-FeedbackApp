-- Important Notes! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I spent at least an hour looking for a bug in the code and I found out that I was being stupid!
Here are some IMPORTANT and SIMPLE things to look for

  1) In your function, do you have a return();
  2) Do you have a export default 'functionName/CompName'
  3) Are you calling the Component in upper Component or App.js
